## Introduction
Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs) are serious infections that occur when germs (bacteria or fungi) enter the bloodstream through a central line, which is a catheter placed in a large vein. Central lines are often used in hospitals to deliver medications, fluids, or nutrition, or to draw blood over an extended period.We have an opportunity to perform EDA on the patients data provided by Texas Children Hospital and further create a plan for modeling and evaluation of metrics.
